This past weekend I went to a party for a business school friend who was in from out of town. It was a great chance to see a good guy and reconnect with a lot of former b-school friends. I enjoyed catching up with former classmates and hearing what was going on in their lives. As part of these exchanges, they would want to know what I was doing for work.

These people know me as someone with a technical acumen, but who has been involved on the marketing and management side of the house. Explaining to them about my foray into coding was rewarding for me.

While many of these people are satisfied with their careers, they don’t have the excitement that I feel about what I’m doing. I am delighted to be learning a new (and difficult) set of skills. It is also invigorating to be part of an industry that is growing and has a “sky’s the limit” attitude. The energy and passion in the field makes it easy to fire up the computer every day and solve some problems.

Over time, I’ll have more of these types of conversations. I look forward to them. Because as I grow more competent in my coding, the pride I feel in my choice to code will grow. These feelings give me a gut reaction (coupled with my rational assessment) that I’ve made a great decision for my future (and hopefully for some eventual employer!).
