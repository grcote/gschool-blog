Week 5 brings more, more and more to Boulder's [gSchool](http://www.gschool) students! Technology, process and design criterion continue to converge in our minds. The instructors, [Mike Gehard](https://twitter.com/mikegehard), [Jeff Dean](https://twitter.com/jeffrosoft) and [Kinsey Durham](https://twitter.com/KinseyAnnDurham), provide the knowledge fueling the confluence. Their success in educating we students is a function of many things. One of which is their commitment to “agile education.”

The term agile education derives conceptually from agile software development. Software development using agile methods focuses on iterative and incremental evolution. It leverages collaboration and flexibility in response to changing conditions. This manifests itself partly in the practice of having testing suites for code. When testing, developers first write a code test that will fail (because no implementation code has been written). This is the red phase. Then they write implementation code to make the test pass (green phase). Finally they go back to the code they wrote and improve it making it more efficient and readable (refactoring).

gSchool’s instructors have taken all these constructs and utilized them to steadily improve their pedagogical approach. They frequently introduce a new method for teaching gleaned from a hypothesis about learning to code (this is the red phase). Using feedback from the class and self-introspection they modify the teaching method until it is effective (green phase). Through tools like retrospectives, student assessments and one-on-one meetings the instructors optimize the teaching method (refactoring). Using this “red, green, refactor” mechanism repeatedly promotes student growth and an improved classroom environment.

The constant improvement through the use of an agile education framework continues to pay dividends for gSchool students. From my perspective the program and its curriculum has steadily improved. The best part of this approach is that with discipline and flexibility it is relatively easy to implement. I look forward to becoming further enmeshed in the process and realizing the benefits of it.
