If you’re wondering what [gSchool](https://www.gschool.it/) is like, it’s kind of like being [the guy in the chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk71h2CQ_xM).

Three weeks in and we’ve all been drinking straight from the hydrant. Our minds are woozy with arrays of vocab words like methods, classes, symbols, procs, lambdas, iterations, TDD, refactoring, keys and hash rockets. If these terms sound foreign to you then you are probably not a web application software engineer (or trying to become one).

Each morning the instructors, [Mike Gehard](https://twitter.com/mikegehard) and [Jeff Dean](https://twitter.com/jeffrosoft), pepper us with previously unfamiliar concepts, frameworks, structures, processes and all things development relevant. Each [pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) provides another Lego block of learning on our path to the coveted title of “Junior Developer.”

Afternoon throws us in the deep end as we struggle to utilize the knowledge imparted to us in the morning. Fortunately we have a “pair” which is our life preserver (or for those paired with me, I’m their undersized water wings). Pair programming (per Wikipedia) is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. “Pairing” has been an excellent experience markedly helping our grasp of the subject matter.

Along with learning how to pair the first three weeks of the program we have focused our efforts on Ruby, Test Driven Development using RSpec, creating dynamic websites, Git and Sinatra. Week 4 promises more of the above and the introduction of Capybara (the testing gem, not the staple of giant anacondas).

Check back next week to see if I’ve upgraded the water wings.
